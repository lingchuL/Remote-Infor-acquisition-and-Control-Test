# Remote Information-Get System
A victim(Dreamer.py), as a server to get attacked by the client(Nightmare.py)

The client can get recent input keyboard documentation, swim in victim's file system and download the file they're interested in. The dreamer.exe has been somehow processed and should be able to escape from victim's prevalent secure software.
